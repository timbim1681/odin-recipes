T.O.P Project: Recipes
Hello!
This is my first official project within The Odin Project.
I will be putting all of the HTML and Git knowledge I've been acquiring so far into practice.
In this project, I will build a basic recipe website.
My goal is to create a recipe website that I will use for meal prepping throughout the year.
I will follow professional standards of coding and committing for the sake of practice.
I will utilize all of the HTML commands that I've learned so far.
